# Technical Questions regarding UK Limited Company Structure

The following list of __"Technical Questions"__ is supposed to be extended,
optimized (regarding the wording and the amount of words),
and restructured, so that nothing is asked twice and question
categories make sense.

goernment institutions and the like, so that a FOSS can be built,
that helps with setting up and maintaining a corporation.
