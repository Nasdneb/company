### Goals
1. About
        every holding (e.g. Ltd. owned and operated by a single person) represents a DIGITAL NOMAD and will hold one or many other (e.g. Ltd's).
        Every project, (e.g. creating an "App") will be owned by 1 or many DIGITAL NOMADs.
2. Trust?
        Open Structure - The contracts how those entities will collaborate with each other shall be open sourced and collaboratively evolved.
        Open Process & Results - Every DIGITAL NOMAD (in the above definition) should work completely transparent (even the monetary transactions and current balance sheets) in order to protect against corruption.
3. Vision?
        There will be a strong focus on automation of all kinds of bureaucracyâ¦ and because projects are co-owned and there are no employees, there is also a need to experiment how to coordinate/synchronize with each other and/or agree upon stuff.
        The or a next step would be to play around with crypto currencies and crypto shares (ethereum.org). The former, because i personally believe that real democracy lies in a correctly structured monetary systems, where money represents votes.

### Goal
Register a business, today

Why?
When selling to people directly (whether you're selling services, or selling products to large companies), people will, as part of their due dilligence, often check when your company was registered. If your company registration date is 2 months ago, you will be at a disadvantage in negotiations about price, up-front payments, and other similar things.
If your company was registered five years ago, though, this point will not be brought up.
In addition, many potential bits of business may come your way over the years. If you have no registered business, you may discard those opportunities because of the perceived difficulty of setting up a business to take advantage of them. Having the business already there may give you the necessary push to grab opportunities.
Finally, simply having a business will change your mindset ever so slightly, and make it more likely that you do some day take the jump. This is simply because of the way our brain works. By taking this extremely easy and minor step towards running your own business, you will make it easier for yourself to take the more difficult, future steps in that direction. Consider it a minor brain hack.

    ACCOUNTING COSTS
    It depends on (among other things)

    Startup and investment costs
    The business the company is in
    The turnover
    The profit
    The location (state and city)
    Who/how the accounting is done (external/internal)
    The division of national/international business
    [SOURCE: unknown](http://www.toytowngermany.com/lofi/index.php/t48164.html)


COSTS for TURNOVER of around 40k
I think you will find the annual "running costs" of a Gmbh or a Ltd will be pretty much the same assuming you are using
an accountant locally here in Germany. On that small turnover you can probably prepare a lot of the information yourself
for the accountant.

I have been in the wars in the past. Basically the UK authorities are a bunch of softies, whereas I can see
the Germans chasing your arse to the firey side of hell and back for €10.
